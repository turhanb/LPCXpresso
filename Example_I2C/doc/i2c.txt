I2C is a bus consisting of 2 lines: clock and data.
These lines are connected from the LPC812 MAX Board
to display module with two wires. Additional two
wires are needed for voltage and ground (ie. powering
the display).

So the display module is connected with total of four (4)
lines that are (board/display):
- GND / GND for ground
- P0_11 / SCL for clocking (I2C bus clock)
- P0_10 / SDA for data     (I2C bus data)
- 5V / Vcc

For communication the devices connected to I2C must obey
the I2C protocol, ie the communication rules for the bus.

The required parts of I2C communication are provided ready.
The only functionality needed is to build the display logic
on top of i2c_write( addr,display_data,10 ), where:
- addr(ess) is always HW_I2C_ADDR_HT16K33 because that is the
  bus address for the display module device
- display_data is _always_ 10 characters, the indexes and data
  (see ht16k33.txt document)
- length of 10 (for length of display_data) is the 3rd parameter
