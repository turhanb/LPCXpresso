HT16K33 is LED controller driver from Holtek (company).
It provides an I2C interface to LEDs. In the case of
Adafruit 7-segment displays the LEDs form the four
7-segment number displays.

Displaying digit information is done by selecting the
bit values of segments to show and combining these
values to display all the required segments.

In case of Adafruit 4 x 7-segment display the display
data consists of 10 characters as follows:
- even characters index the digit, one should use 0,1,2,3,4 as indexes
  - 0 is the left most digit
  - 1 is the next digit
  - 2 is for the "colon" at center
  - 3 is the first digit after colon
  - 4 is the right most digit
- odd characters select the segment combinations for displaying (light on)
- segment "bit values" are as follows
  1 1 1
32     2
32     2
32     2
  64 64
16     4
16     4
16     4
  8 8 8
         128
- these are bit values in the sense that all of them correspond to single power of 2
  1   = 2^0
  2   = 2^1
  128 = 2^7
- this means that the top segment "-" is displayed alone by sending value "1"
- top and bottom segments "=" is dislpayed with sum of "1" and "64", ie value "65"
- upper rectangle is value 99 (for 1+2+32+64)
- lower rectangle is value 92 (for 4+8+16+64)
- decimal point is value "128"

For displaying a value like 5681 one needs to:
- separate the individual digits, ie calculate '5', '6', '8', and 1 (from the value)
- map each of digits '5', '6', '8' and '1' to the actual segments
- display the actual segments at correct positions

For example, displaying "1000" one needs to send 10 bytes to the display device as:
- 0,6,1,63,2,0,3,63,4,63
- as these correspond to the following:
  0 - index 0 meaning first digit
  6 - segments for digit "1"
  1 - index 1 for the 2nd digit
  63 - segments for digit "0"
  2 - index 2 for colon sign
  0 - colon NOT displayed at all
  3 - index 3 for second to last digit
  63 - segments for digit "0"
  4 - index 4 for the last digit
  63 - segments for digit "0"
